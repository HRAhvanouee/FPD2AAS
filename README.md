The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) plays a central role in Industry 4.0 by providing a standardized digital representation of assets, facilitating interoperability, modularization, and integration across industrial systems. To support the modeling of processes within this framework, a common challenge lies in aligning existing process modeling approaches with the semantic structure of AAS submodels. This paper proposes a structured methodology for mapping Formal Process Description (FPD) models to AAS Format. By analyzing the conceptual alignment between FPD elements and the semantic constructs of the AAS, the approach bridges the gap between domain-specific process models and the standardized representation required for Industry 4.0 ecosystems. A mapping methodology is introduced and demonstrated through a representative use case, illustrating the practical benefits for interoperability and digital continuity in process modeling.
